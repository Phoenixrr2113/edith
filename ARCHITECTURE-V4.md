# Edith v4: Orchestrator Architecture

## North Star: The Cortana/Bonzi Spectrum

Edith is modeled on Cortana from Halo — an AI partner embedded in your life, not a tool you query. She sees what you see, knows your context, acts before you ask, and has real judgment about when to speak and when to stay silent.

The anti-pattern is Bonzi Buddy — the proactive desktop assistant that interrupted constantly with nothing useful. The line between Cortana and Bonzi is razor thin. Both are "proactive AI assistants." The difference is judgment.

**The twist**: Bonzi wasn't bad because it was quirky or visible — it was bad because it was dumb. A Bonzi with Cortana's brain would be delightful. Edith should be:
- **Cortana's brain** — smart, contextual, proactive with judgment, earns every interruption
- **Bonzi's charm** — visible presence, personality, character, not hidden in a chat window
- **Neither's worst traits** — not annoying, not a corporate AI voice, not spyware

### Design Principles

1. **Every interruption must earn its cost.** Randy's attention is the scarcest resource. If what you have isn't worth breaking his flow, don't.
2. **Do the work first, decide if it's worth mentioning second.** Don't say "I noticed X." Fix X, then tell him what you did.
3. **Silence is the default.** Speaking up is the exception that requires justification.
4. **Never state the obvious.** If Randy can see it on his screen, don't tell him. ("Looks like you're writing an email!" = Bonzi)
5. **Have a personality.** Sharp, witty, opinionated. A brilliant friend, not a corporate assistant.
6. **Be a presence, not a service.** Edith should feel like someone who's WITH you — not an app you open.

### The Presence Question

Edith needs a face. Not a status dashboard. Not just a Telegram chat. Something that makes her feel like a companion on your machine:
- Desktop widget / floating avatar / menu bar presence?
- Reacts to what's happening (screen awareness feeds state)
- Visual indicator of what she's doing (workers running, thinking, idle)
- Personality expressed through motion/state, not just text

This is an open design question — the form factor matters as much as the intelligence.

---

## Why

Edith v3 is single-threaded — one Claude session at a time, FIFO queue, busy flag. This means:
- Randy waits with no visibility while work runs (just a typing indicator)
- If a morning brief takes 3 minutes, messages queue up
- If something breaks mid-session, nobody knows until timeout
- 27 lib files handle queuing, session management, reflection, dead-letters — complexity from a fundamentally limited model

**v4 Goal**: Edith becomes an orchestrator that spawns sub-agents for work, stays responsive, and streams live progress to Telegram. Way more capability with way less code.

## Decision Log

- **Claude Desktop migration**: Abandoned. Claude Desktop's scheduler can't match Edith's battle-tested dispatch (dead-letter recovery, circuit breakers, session continuity, brief building). Delete the migrated scheduled tasks at `~/.claude/scheduled-tasks/` and services at `~/.claude/services/`.
- **Dashboard**: Deprioritized. `dashboard.ts` still exists (localhost:3456) but isn't actively maintained. Telegram is the primary visibility channel.
- **Orchestrator scope**: Brain handles lightweight tasks directly (quick questions, reminders, status checks). Only heavy work spawns workers.

---

## Architecture (Implemented)

### How It Works Today

**edith.ts** (TypeScript daemon) handles Telegram polling, scheduling, and dispatching. When a message or scheduled task arrives, it dispatches to a persistent Claude session via the Agent SDK.

**The orchestrator** is Edith herself (the Claude session). Her system prompt tells her to:
- Handle light tasks directly (quick questions, lookups, reminders)
- Spawn background agents via the Agent tool for heavy work (email triage, meeting prep, briefs)
- Stay responsive while background agents run

**Background agents** are defined in `.claude/agents/` with scoped tools and system prompts. They run as ephemeral sessions spawned by the Agent tool with `run_in_background: true`.

### Message Flow

```
Telegram message → edith.ts → dispatch to Claude session
  → Edith decides:
     Light? → handles directly (manage_calendar, send_message)
     Heavy? → spawns Agent with run_in_background: true
  → Background agent does the work (email, calendar, Cognee, files)
  → task_started / task_progress / task_notification events stream through
  → dispatch.ts logs all events
  → Agent finishes → Edith reads result, sends summary to Randy
```

### Scheduled Tasks

```
Scheduler fires "morning-brief" at 8:03
  → edith.ts dispatches to Claude session with "[Scheduled: morning-brief]"
  → Edith spawns morning-briefer agent in background
  → Agent does all the work
  → Edith stays free for incoming messages (when busy flag is resolved)
```

### Progress Visibility

Task events stream through the parent query and are logged by `dispatch.ts` to console and JSONL:
- `🚀 task_started` — agent spawned with description
- `📊 task_progress` — periodic updates with `last_tool_name`, token count, tool uses, duration
- `🏁 task_notification` — completion/failure with summary and usage stats

**Note:** These events are logged locally only. No live Telegram progress updates yet — Randy only sees the final result message when the agent completes.

### Verified Behavior (2026-03-28)

Test: "check my email from the last 24 hours, triage everything, prep for any meetings"
- Edith acknowledged immediately ("On it — triaging...")
- Spawned background agent: "Email triage and meeting prep"
- Agent ran 14 tool calls over 142 seconds
- Called: manage_emails, cognee search, manage_calendar, cognee cognify, send_message
- Sent results to Randy via Telegram: 2 actionable items flagged, 14 archived
- Total cost: $0.40

---

## What Changed (2026-03-28)

**No new modules needed.** The orchestrator pattern was achieved with:

- `prompts/system.md` — added orchestrator instructions (light vs heavy tasks, how to spawn background agents)
- `lib/dispatch.ts` — ~20 lines added to log `task_started`, `task_progress`, `task_notification` SDK events
- `.claude/agents/` — 10 agent definitions:
  - **morning-briefer** — calendar, email, Cognee, meeting prep, file prep (sonnet)
  - **midday-checker** — catch changes, prep afternoon, advance deadlines (sonnet)
  - **evening-wrapper** — day review, tomorrow prep, Cognee storage (sonnet)
  - **weekend-briefer** — family activities, local events, weather, beach (sonnet)
  - **email-triager** — scan inbox, archive noise, draft replies (sonnet)
  - **weekly-reviewer** — GTD weekly review, Google Doc output (sonnet)
  - **monthly-reviewer** — scorecard, life areas, retrospective (sonnet)
  - **quarterly-reviewer** — strategic review, trajectory (sonnet)
  - **researcher** — web + codebase research (sonnet)
  - **reminder-checker** — time-based reminders only (haiku)

The Agent tool handles spawning. `stopTask(taskId)` on the Query interface handles cancellation. No custom MCP tools, no WorkerPool class, no orchestrator module. Everything else (dispatch engine, session management, scheduler, Telegram) works as-is.

---

## Internal Subsystems (Underdocumented)

These systems exist in the codebase and are actively used, but weren't covered in the original architecture doc.

### Brief Building (`lib/briefs.ts`, `lib/prewake.ts`)
Before Claude wakes, Edith pre-fetches calendar and email from n8n and assembles a context brief. 8 brief types: boot, morning, midday, evening, message, location, scheduled, proactive. Pre-wake optimization saves Claude turns by front-loading context.

### Reflection System (`lib/reflector.ts`)
Observes running sessions and injects contextual feedback via `streamInput()`. Triggers after every Nth tool call, on context compaction, and on irreversible tool use (send_message, manage_emails writes). Guards geofencing-sensitive operations. Non-blocking fire-and-forget.

### Screen Awareness (`lib/screenpipe.ts`, `lib/gemini.ts`, `lib/audio-extract.ts`)
- **Screenpipe client** — health check, OCR + audio context, app usage tracking, continuous activity calculation
- **Gemini summarization** — Gemini 2.5 Flash for screen context summaries, skips LLM for trivial cases
- **Audio extraction** — Qwen 3 235B (OpenRouter) extracts structured knowledge from meeting audio (decisions, action items)

Workers (morning-briefer, midday-checker, evening-wrapper, reviewers) all have `mcp__screenpipe__activity-summary` in their allowed tools.

### Transcript Logging (`lib/transcript.ts`)
Every session is logged to JSONL — tool uses, text blocks, results, costs. Skips stream events to minimize size. Used for debugging and the `/costs` skill.

### Proactive Interventions (`lib/proactive.ts`)
Rate limiting infrastructure for proactive messages: quiet hours (22:00–08:00), per-category cooldowns (60min), max 2 interventions/hour. `canIntervene()` and `recordIntervention()` are wired into the MCP server. **Gap:** The trigger that decides WHEN to proactively intervene is not connected to the main loop — infrastructure exists but no automatic firing.

### Session Injection (`lib/session.ts`)
Tracks the active Agent SDK query handle. Exposes `streamInput()` for mid-session message injection — new messages/tasks inject into the running session instead of waiting in the dispatch queue.

### Caffeinate (`lib/caffeinate.ts`)
Prevents macOS sleep while Edith is running (`caffeinate -dis -w PID`).

---

## Next Steps

### Near-term (POC hardening)
- ~~Fix busy flag~~ Done — streamInput injection handles mid-session messages (see Known Limitations)
- ~~Add more agent types~~ Done — 10 agents covering briefs, reviews, email, research, reminders
- Remove Docker dependency — run n8n as child process, Cognee via MCP stdio (see Embedded Services). Docker still required today.
- Clean up disabled Claude Desktop scheduled tasks at `~/.claude/scheduled-tasks/`
- Wire proactive intervention triggers into main loop (infrastructure built in lib/proactive.ts, trigger not connected)
- Stream task progress to Telegram (currently only logged to console/JSONL)

### Future (when ready)
- Desktop companion (Tauri + Rive) — see Desktop Companion section
- Screen awareness (Gemini Live API) — see Future: Real-Time Screen Awareness
- Product packaging — see Distribution: Edith as a Product
- Code cleanup — remove unused lib files as orchestrator pattern proves stable

---

## Future: Real-Time Screen Awareness (v5 vision)

### The Idea
Kill Screenpipe. Stream Randy's screen to Gemini Live API continuously. Edith watches what he's doing in real-time, researches in the background, offers contextual suggestions, and can take over tasks when asked.

### What's Viable Now

**Passive screen awareness via Gemini Live API:**
- Native screen share via WebSocket, 1 FPS, 320ms latency
- Cost: ~$2.22/8hr day on Gemini 2.5 Flash (viable for always-on)
- Session limits: unlimited with context compression, ~10min connection lifetime with 2hr resumption tokens
- Replaces Screenpipe's OCR snapshots with actual visual understanding
- Could trigger Edith workers based on what Randy is doing (e.g., sees him in a code editor → spawns a worker to research the library he's using)

**Architecture sketch:**
```
Screen capture (macOS) → Gemini Live API (1 FPS, always watching)
  → Gemini understands context: "Randy is writing TypeScript in VS Code, file: auth.ts"
  → Sends context updates to Edith orchestrator
  → Orchestrator decides: spawn worker for background research? offer suggestion? stay silent?
  → If Randy asks "take over" → Claude computer use kicks in (screenshot-based, proven)
```

### What's NOT Viable Yet

**Real-time computer control with video feedback:**
- The bottleneck is LLM thinking time (1-5s per decision), not screenshot capture (~100ms)
- Continuous video wouldn't make computer use faster — the AI still thinks at the same speed
- Current best: Claude Opus 4.6 at 72.7% on OSWorld, 2-5s per action cycle
- Later steps take ~3x longer as context window grows (quadratic prefill)

**The hybrid pattern (emerging but unshipped):**
- Fast local model (OmniParser V2, Microsoft, 0.6s on A100) for UI element parsing
- Smart remote model (Claude/GPT-4o) for decision-making only when triggered
- SAM2 (Meta, open source) for real-time object tracking at 13-44 FPS — could track cursor/windows but not designed for UI
- Nobody has combined these into a working computer-use agent yet

### Cost Analysis

| Approach | Cost/hour | 8hr day |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Gemini Flash passive watching (1 FPS) | ~$0.28 | ~$2.22 |
| Hybrid: local model + Gemini on change detection | ~$0.25 | ~$2.00 |
| GPT-4o continuous (1 FPS, high detail) | ~$9.94 | ~$79.50 |
| Claude Sonnet continuous (1 FPS) | ~$11.95 | ~$95.60 |

Gemini Flash is ~40x cheaper than alternatives for image-heavy workloads. Only viable option for always-on.

### Implementation Path (not yet planned)
1. Screen capture module (macOS CGDisplayStream or similar → frames)
2. Gemini Live API WebSocket client (send frames, receive context summaries)
3. Context bridge → Edith orchestrator (structured updates about what Randy is doing)
4. Proactive worker spawning (research, suggestions based on screen context)
5. Computer use integration (Claude screenshot-based, triggered on "take over" requests)

## n8n as Integration Backend

n8n already handles Gmail and Calendar via webhooks. The pattern: **build integrations as n8n workflows, expose as webhook endpoints, Edith calls them like APIs.** n8n becomes Edith's integration backend — handles OAuth, retries, and error handling. Visually editable without touching code.

### Current n8n Workflows
- `calendar` — get, create, update, delete events (both Google accounts)
- `gmail` — get, send, reply, draft, archive, trash, batch manage (both accounts)
- `docs` — create Google Docs with content
- `notify` — route notifications to Telegram, WhatsApp, SMS

### Not in n8n (direct API)
- **Transcription** — Groq Whisper via `mcp/server.ts` (n8n HTTP Request had connectivity issues)
- **SMS/WhatsApp** — `lib/twilio.ts` handles directly for the MCP `send_notification` tool
- **Image gen** — Google Imagen via `@google/generative-ai` SDK

### Potential Future Workflows
- **google-tasks** — create, list, update tasks
- **google-drive** — search, read, share docs
- **google-contacts** — lookup, create contacts

### How It Connects

```
Edith spawns background agent (Agent tool, run_in_background: true)
  → Agent needs to read emails
  → Agent calls manage_emails MCP tool
  → MCP tool POSTs to n8n webhook: POST /webhook/gmail { action: "get", hoursBack: 4 }
  → n8n handles OAuth, pagination, formatting
  → Returns structured data to Agent
  → Agent drafts replies, calls manage_emails to send
  → MCP tool POSTs to n8n: POST /webhook/gmail { action: "send", to: "...", body: "..." }
```

### MCP Server Structure

`mcp/server.ts` (540+ lines) registers 25+ tools. Most Google tools are thin wrappers around `n8nPost()`. Telegram, Twilio, image generation, and transcription call APIs directly. See `n8n/WORKFLOWS.md` for details on what's in n8n vs direct API.

### What n8n Does NOT Handle
- Orchestrator brain (persistent Claude session — Agent SDK only)
- Worker pool (parallel Claude sessions — Agent SDK only)
- Telegram polling (needs persistent connection, not webhook-friendly for real-time)
- Desktop companion (Tauri app, local process)
- Screen awareness (Gemini Live stream, local process)
- Cognee memory (separate Docker service, MCP)

### Tradeoff
More n8n = less TypeScript code, easier to modify integrations, visual editing. But adds a dependency — n8n must be running and healthy. Current setup already depends on n8n for Gmail/Calendar, so this just extends that pattern.

### n8n and Distribution: The Problem

n8n **cannot** be bundled in a packaged app for end users:
- **$50K/year embed license** — required for any product that ships n8n to users
- **OAuth injection broken** — n8n's API blocks writing `oauthTokenData`, so the parent app can't handle Google login and pass tokens to n8n. Users would see n8n's UI.

**For a packaged product, n8n gets replaced entirely:**
- Google OAuth handled natively via `tauri-plugin-oauth` (login screen in Edith's app UI)
- `googleapis` npm package for Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Tasks, Contacts
- Tokens stored in macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager (secure, automatic)
- No background process, no licensing fees

**The transition path:**
```
Now (personal use):
  n8n handles Gmail/Calendar — quick, visual, already working

Packaged product (later):
  Tauri app handles OAuth + Google APIs directly
  n8n goes away entirely
  MCP tool interface stays identical — workers don't know the difference
```

This means the MCP tool layer (`manage_emails`, `manage_calendar`) is an abstraction that can swap backends without changing anything upstream.

---

## Desktop Companion (Tauri App)

Edith needs a face — not a dashboard, a character. A visible presence on the desktop like a smart Bonzi Buddy.

### Tech Stack
- **Tauri v2** — Rust + web view, 30-50MB RAM (vs Electron's 150-300MB)
- **Rive** — character animation with state machine (idle, thinking, talking, sleeping). Free editor, tiny `.riv` files. Used by Duolingo.
- **React** — UI chrome (speech bubbles, status indicators)
- Transparent, frameless, always-on-top window with click-through

### How It Works
- `NSPanel` equivalent via Tauri: floating, non-activating, appears on all Spaces
- Click-through when not interacting (clicks pass to apps behind)
- Character reacts to Edith's state: idle (nothing happening), thinking (worker running), talking (message from Edith), sleeping (night mode)
- Speech bubbles for messages alongside Telegram
- Can show worker progress visually (character "working" animation + subtle status text)

### Connection to Edith
- Connects to orchestrator via WebSocket or local HTTP
- Another input/output channel alongside Telegram
- Can accept voice input (mic → transcribe → orchestrator)
- Can show screen awareness reactions (Edith noticed something)

### Reference Projects
- **WindowPet** (Tauri + React + Phaser) — overlay/window mechanics
- **Open-LLM-VTuber** (Electron + Live2D + LLM) — AI companion with desktop pet mode

---

## Distribution: Edith as a Product

### The Vision
A downloadable app anyone can install. No Docker, no n8n, no Screenpipe, no terminal. Just Edith.

### Install Experience
```
1. Download Edith.dmg (macOS) / Edith.exe (Windows) / Edith.AppImage (Linux)
2. Open → Edith appears on your desktop
3. "Hi, I'm Edith. Let's get you set up."
4. Sign in with Google (OAuth in-app) → Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Tasks connected
5. Enter Claude API key (or sign in with Anthropic account)
6. Optional: Enter Gemini API key for screen awareness
7. Done — Edith is watching, thinking, helping
```

### Phasing Strategy

**Phase 1 — POC (now):** Build everything on n8n + Claude Agent SDK + Bun. Fast iteration, visual workflows, already working. Ship the orchestrator/worker architecture, screen awareness, desktop companion. Get it working for Randy.

**Phase 2 — Polish (when it works):** Harden the system, tune the orchestrator prompt, add more n8n workflows for new integrations. Still personal use. n8n is fine here.

**Phase 3 — Product (if/when investors):** Replace n8n with direct API calls in Rust/Node. Replace Cognee with bundled SQLite + vector DB. Package as Tauri binary. Build onboarding flow. This is the expensive phase — only do it if there's a business case.

**The MCP tool interface is the abstraction boundary.** `manage_emails`, `manage_calendar`, `send_notification` — same inputs, same outputs, regardless of backend. Workers and the orchestrator never know what's behind the tools. Swap n8n for native code without touching anything upstream.

### Cross-Platform Considerations
- Tauri v2 supports macOS, Windows, Linux
- Screen capture APIs differ per OS (macOS: CGDisplayStream, Windows: DXGI, Linux: PipeWire)
- Keychain/credential storage is OS-specific (Tauri handles this)
- Always-on-top window behavior varies (Tauri abstracts most of it)
- Computer use (when added) is OS-specific (mouse/keyboard control)

---

## Embedded Services (No Docker)

Docker has been a pain point — port conflicts, stale containers, extra dependency. Both n8n and Cognee can run without Docker.

### n8n (child process)
- `npx n8n start` — Node.js app, SQLite by default, no Postgres
- Edith spawns as child process in `launch-edith.sh`
- Point `N8N_USER_FOLDER` at `./n8n/data` (existing workflows + credentials carry over)
- Set `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` from `.env` (must match across restarts)
- ~100MB RAM idle
- Import workflows: `n8n import:workflow --input=./workflows.json`

### Cognee (MCP stdio)
- Switch from Docker SSE to local stdio mode in `.mcp.json`:
  ```json
  "cognee": { "command": "uv", "args": ["--directory", "./cognee-mcp", "run", "cognee"] }
  ```
- Uses SQLite + LanceDB + NetworkX — all file-based, zero servers
- Embedding model upgrade: **`BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5`** (replaces nomic-embed-text-v1.5)
  - +1.27 MTEB points (63.55 vs 62.28)
  - 2.5x smaller (210MB vs 520MB)
  - Faster on CPU (~22ms vs ~42ms per 1K tokens)
  - Same 768 dims — drop-in replacement
  - No prefix prompts needed
- Config: `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=fastembed`, `EMBEDDING_MODEL=BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5`

### Result
`launch-edith.sh` becomes:
1. Start n8n as child process
2. Start Edith (Cognee starts automatically via MCP stdio)
3. Done — no Docker, no port conflicts, no stale containers

---

## Known Limitations

### Busy flag mitigated with streamInput injection
The dispatch engine's `busy` flag in `lib/dispatch.ts` is set to `true` while the orchestrator session is running. When a new message or scheduled task arrives while busy, `dispatch()` now attempts `streamInput()` injection into the active session (line 296-301). If injection succeeds, the message is handled inline without queuing.

**Remaining gap:** If injection fails (e.g., session not in a state that accepts input), `skipIfBusy` tasks are still dropped. In practice this is rare — most injections succeed.

---

## Resolved Questions

- **Worker results → orchestrator?** Resolved: `task_notification` SDK events stream back automatically. Orchestrator reads the summary and acts on it. See `dispatch.ts` line 196.
- **Screenpipe access?** Resolved: Workers (midday-checker, evening-wrapper, morning-briefer, reviewers) have `mcp__screenpipe__activity-summary` in their allowed tools. Orchestrator accesses it through workers, not directly.
- **Context window fills up?** Handled by Claude Code's automatic context compression. Sessions continue with compressed history.
- **Sub-workers?** No. Flat structure — orchestrator spawns agents, agents don't spawn sub-agents.

## Open Questions

- Cost budget per worker? Per day? Alert thresholds? (Currently tracked via `/costs` skill but no enforcement)
